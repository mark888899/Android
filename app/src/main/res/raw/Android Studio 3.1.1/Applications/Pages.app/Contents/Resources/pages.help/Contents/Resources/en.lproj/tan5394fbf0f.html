Their changes don’t affect the original document or any other copies of the document. You can send the copy as a Pages document or in another format—PDF, Microsoft Word, or ePub.</p><p>If the original file has a password, it applies to the copy as well, and recipients must know the password to open the copy. You can keep the original password or assign a different password to the copy.</p><div id="apd3290d07379c54" class="Task"><h2 role="button" aria-controls="aria-apd3290d07379c54" aria-expanded="true" class="Name">Send a copy in another format</h2><div class="TaskBody" role="region" aria-hidden="false" id="aria-apd3290d07379c54"><ol><li><p>Click a format, then specify settings:</p><ul><li><p><em>Pages: </em>Select the checkbox and add a password if you want to restrict access to the copy.</p></li><li><p><em>PDF: </em> Click the Image Quality pop-up menu, then choose an image quality (the higher the image quality, the larger the file size of the copy).</p></li><li><p><em>Word: </em> Click the disclosure triangle next to Advanced Options and choose a format.</p></li><li><p><em>ePub: </em> Enter the title and author name.
